ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @meetpsm0146, an embedded systems engineer. I am looking forward to working on multiple embedded systems projects from outside India at reasonable rates, offering:

    Utmost care, reliability, and robust designs.
    If the projects are from the open-source community, I am happy to work free of cost.

Additionally, I am willing to provide free online live training, in the title of Linux administration, a 10 hour session, containing 5 theory units and 5 practical units, CCNA full networking concepts, Embedded system and IOT in ESP32 microcontroller with 40 Experiments, STM32 micro controllers 10 experiments, a total of 220 hours including:

    One-to-one sessions,
    A focus on hands-on practice,
    Comprehensive doubt-clearing sessions.

Participants will only need to arrange their own hardware kits for the training. Letâ€™s connect and create something innovative together! ðŸš€
