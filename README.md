ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @meetpsm0146, an embedded systems engineer. I am looking forward to working on multiple embedded systems projects from outside India at reasonable rates, offering:

    Utmost care, reliability, and robust designs.
    If the projects are from the open-source community, I am happy to work free of cost.

Additionally, I am willing to provide free online live training, including:

    One-to-one sessions,
    A focus on hands-on practice,
    Comprehensive doubt-clearing sessions.

Participants will only need to arrange their own hardware kits for the training. Letâ€™s connect and create something innovative together! ðŸš€
